#### Total: **7** :star:

## Day 1
I didn't enconter that much trouble with the **Part 1** of the problem. **Part 2** was a bit more difficult but I could resolve it at the end with some help in ***Reddit***.

## Day 2
This problem was easier that the first one, I solved **Part 1** really fast and **Part 2** too.

## Day 3
***I am still working in this problem.***


## Day 4
I've done **Part 1** really fast. **Part 2** was really more difficult to me, I get trouble with the variable *multiplier* because I didn't take into account where I had to reset it.

## Day 5
***I am still working in this problem.***
